Write a solution to report the spending of each user.

Return the resulting table ordered by spending in descending order. In case of a tie, order them by user_id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Sales table:
+---------+------------+---------+----------+
| sale_id | product_id | user_id | quantity |
+---------+------------+---------+----------+
| 1       | 1          | 101     | 10       |
| 2       | 2          | 101     | 1        |
| 3       | 3          | 102     | 3        |
| 4       | 3          | 102     | 2        |
| 5       | 2          | 103     | 3        |
+---------+------------+---------+----------+
Product table:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 1          | 10    |
| 2          | 25    |
| 3          | 15    |
+------------+-------+
Output: 
+---------+----------+
| user_id | spending |
+---------+----------+
| 101     | 125      |
| 102     | 75       |
| 103     | 75       |
+---------+----------+
Explanation: 
User 101 spent 10 * 10 + 1 * 25 = 125.
User 102 spent 3 * 15 + 2 * 15 = 75.
User 103 spent 3 * 25 = 75.
Users 102 and 103 spent the same amount and we break the tie by their ID while user 101 is on the top. */
