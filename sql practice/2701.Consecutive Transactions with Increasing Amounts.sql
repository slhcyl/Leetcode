Table: Transactions

+------------------+------+
| Column Name      | Type |
+------------------+------+
| transaction_id   | int  |
| customer_id      | int  |
| transaction_date | date |
| amount           | int  |
+------------------+------+
transaction_id is the primary key of this table. 
Each row contains information about transactions that includes unique (customer_id, transaction_date) along with the corresponding customer_id and amount.  
Write an SQL query to find the customers who have made consecutive transactions with increasing amount for at least three consecutive days. Include the customer_id, start date of the consecutive transactions period and the end date of the consecutive transactions period. There can be multiple consecutive transactions by a customer.

Return the result table ordered by customer_id in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Transactions table:
+----------------+-------------+------------------+--------+
| transaction_id | customer_id | transaction_date | amount |
+----------------+-------------+------------------+--------+
| 1              | 101         | 2023-05-01       | 100    |
| 2              | 101         | 2023-05-02       | 150    |
| 3              | 101         | 2023-05-03       | 200    |
| 4              | 102         | 2023-05-01       | 50     |
| 5              | 102         | 2023-05-03       | 100    |
| 6              | 102         | 2023-05-04       | 200    |
| 7              | 105         | 2023-05-01       | 100    |
| 8              | 105         | 2023-05-02       | 150    |
| 9              | 105         | 2023-05-03       | 200    |
| 10             | 105         | 2023-05-04       | 300    |
| 11             | 105         | 2023-05-12       | 250    |
| 12             | 105         | 2023-05-13       | 260    |
| 13             | 105         | 2023-05-14       | 270    |
+----------------+-------------+------------------+--------+
Output: 
+-------------+-------------------+-----------------+
| customer_id | consecutive_start | consecutive_end | 
+-------------+-------------------+-----------------+
| 101         |  2023-05-01       | 2023-05-03      | 
| 105         |  2023-05-01       | 2023-05-04      |

Explanation: 
- customer_id 101 has made consecutive transactions with increasing amounts from May 1st, 2023, to May 3rd, 2023
- customer_id 102 does not have any consecutive transactions for at least 3 days. 
- customer_id 105 has two sets of consecutive transactions: from May 1st, 2023, to May 4th, 2023, and from May 12th, 2023, to May 14th, 2023. 
customer_id is sorted in ascending order. */
