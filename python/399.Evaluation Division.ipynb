    "Let's analyze the time and space complexities for the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "1. **Graph Construction:**\n",
    "   - Building the graph involves iterating through the `equations` list.\n",
    "   - Each equation adds two edges (forward and reverse) to the graph.\n",
    "   - Thus, graph construction has a time complexity of \\( O(E) \\), where \\( E \\) is the number of equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Depth-First Search (DFS) for Queries:**\n",
    "   - Each DFS traverses a path between two nodes. In the worst case, the traversal can visit all nodes.\n",
    "   - The time complexity of one DFS traversal is \\( O(V + E) \\), where:\n",
    "     - \\( V \\) is the number of nodes (variables) in the graph.\n",
    "     - \\( E \\) is the total number of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple Queries:**\n",
    "   - Let \\( Q \\) denote the number of queries.\n",
    "   - For each query, a DFS is performed.\n",
    "   - Therefore, the total time complexity for all queries is \\( O(Q \\times (V + E)) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "1. **Graph Storage:**\n",
    "   - The graph is stored as an adjacency list.\n",
    "   - Each node (variable) has at most two edges per equation (forward and reverse).\n",
    "   - Therefore, the space complexity for the graph is \\( O(V + E) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DFS Recursion Stack:**\n",
    "   - Each DFS can reach a maximum depth of \\( V \\), which means the recursion stack may hold up to \\( V \\) elements.\n",
    "   - Thus, the space complexity for recursion is \\( O(V) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visited Set:**\n",
    "   - Each DFS traversal uses a set to track visited nodes.\n",
    "   - The set can contain up to \\( V \\) nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result List:**\n",
    "   - The results list stores \\( Q \\) floating-point numbers, which has a space complexity of \\( O(Q) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Overall Space Complexity:**\n",
    "   - Combining all the components, the overall space complexity is \\( O(V + E + Q) \\).\n",
    "\n",
