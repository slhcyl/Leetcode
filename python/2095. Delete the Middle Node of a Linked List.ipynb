    "The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the start using 0-based indexing, where ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x.\n",

    "The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.\n",

    "The key of this approach is that we have two pointers fast and slow traversing the linked list at the same time, and fast traverses twice as fast as slow. Therefore, when fast reaches the end of the linked list, slow is right in the middle! We only need one iteration to reach the middle node!\n",
    "\n",
    "All that needs to be determined are a few lookup details. If there is only one node in the linked list, this node is also the one to be deleted and there are no nodes left after the deletion. Therefore, instead of initializing two pointers for the following procedure, we can just return null.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why we initialize fast = head.next.next at the begining?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this is that we want to deleted the middle node instead of finding it. Therefore, we are actually looking for the predecessor of the middle node, not the middle node itself, or rather, this is like moving slow backward one node after the iteration stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly, we can't move a pointer backward on a singly linked list, thus we can show this one less step on slow by letting fast moves forward one more step (by two nodes, of course). Hence, slow will also point to the predecessor node of the middle node (rather than the middle node) at the end of the iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm\n",
    "If there is only one node, return null.\n",
    "Otherwise, initialize two pointers slow and fast, with slow pointing to head and fast pointing to the second successor node of head.\n",
    "While neither fast and fast.next is null:\n",
    "we move fast forward by 2 nodes.\n",
    "we move slow forward by 1 node.\n",
    "Now slow is the predecessor of the middle node, delete the middle node.\n",
    "Return head."
