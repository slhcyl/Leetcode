    "Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.\n",

    "The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.\n",
