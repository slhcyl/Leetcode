    "Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.\n",

    "The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.\n",

In this way, we can go from \"obvious\" statements, all the way to the one we want to prove. I recommend reading each statement one by one, ensuring that you understand each before moving to the next.\n",
