    "Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the solution for the \"Rotting Oranges\" problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "1. **Initial Traversal:**\n",
    "   - The initial traversal of the grid to identify all rotten and fresh oranges has a time complexity of \\( O(M \\times N) \\), where \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) represent the number of rows and columns, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**\n",
    "   - Each cell can be processed only once in the BFS.\n",
    "   - Each rotten orange processes its adjacent cells and propagates rotting to fresh oranges.\n",
    "   - This also results in \\( O(M \\times N) \\) operations, since each cell can only be enqueued and dequeued once.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overall Complexity:**\n",
    "   - Combining both the initial grid traversal and the BFS, the total time complexity is:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   O(M \\times N)\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "1. **Queue:**\n",
    "   - The queue used for the BFS can hold at most all the cells in the grid.\n",
    "   - Therefore, the space complexity for the queue is \\( O(M \\times N) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Visited Data Structure:**\n",
    "   - Instead of using a separate visited set, the grid is directly updated to mark rotten oranges.\n",
    "   - Thus, no extra space is required for a visited set.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Other Variables:**\n",
    "   - Other variables like `directions`, `minutes_elapsed`, and simple counters occupy constant space.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Overall Complexity:**\n",
    "   - The total space complexity is:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   O(M \\times N)\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the solution has both time and space complexity of \\( O(M \\times N) \\)."
