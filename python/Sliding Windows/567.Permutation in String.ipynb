    "Time Complexity\n",
    "Initialization of Maps: You initialize two maps (s1map and s2map) and populate them based on the length of s1. This process takes O(m) time, where m is the length of s1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sliding Window Setup and Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "You slide a window across s2 with the window size fixed to the length of s1 (m). For each new character in s2 that enters the window, you perform an update operation on s2map and potentially adjust the window by moving the left pointer and updating or deleting entries in s2map.\n",
    "Map Comparison: At each step, you compare s1map with s2map. The comparison of two dictionaries is O(u) where u is the number of unique characters in s1. In the worst case, this could involve comparing up to 26 entries (assuming the input is restricted to lowercase alphabets, though the problem states uppercase; for uppercase, it's the same number).\n",
    "Since you compare the dictionaries potentially for each character in s2 after the initial setup, the overall complexity of the sliding window part becomes O((n-m) * u) where n is the length of s2.\n",
    "Given these steps, the total time complexity of your algorithm is O(m + (n-m) * u). Simplifying this for worst-case scenarios and typical character set limits, the complexity is approximately O(n * u) if u is significantly smaller than m.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity\n",
    "Space Usage for Maps: The space complexity is dominated by the two dictionaries you maintain:\n",
    "s1map which stores the frequency of each character in s1. This map's size is bounded by the number of unique characters in s1, which is at most u.\n",
    "s2map is similarly bounded by u in the worst case, reflecting the maximum number of unique characters that can appear in the substring of s2 being compared.\n",
    "Therefore, the space complexity is O(u), where u is the number of unique characters in the character set of the input strings. Given the problem's constraints on character types (uppercase English letters), u could be considered as 26, making the space complexity effectively O(1) as it does not scale with the size of the input strings but is instead constant based on the fixed character set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "Time Complexity: O(n * u), which simplifies to O(n) if u is a small constant (like 26 for English letters).\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(u), simplifying to O(1) under assumptions of a fixed and small character set (such as English alphabets)."
