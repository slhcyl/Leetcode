    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Merge the sorted halves: Once each half of the data is sorted, the two halves are merged back into one final sorted array. The merging process involves comparing the first elements of each half and inserting the smaller element into the final array. This process continues until one of the halves is empty. The remaining elements of the other half are then inserted into the final array.\n",

In each iteration, the smaller of the two elements from the first and second half is copied into the original array \"arr\".\n",

    "Create a recursive function called mergeSort which takes in the original array arr, indices left, right, and a temporary array tempArr as parameters.\n",
