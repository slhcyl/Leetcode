    "Approach 1: Merge Sort\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. The intuition behind it is to divide the data set into smaller and smaller sub-arrays until it is easy to sort, and then merge the sorted sub-arrays back into a larger sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps for implementing Merge Sort are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide the data set into two equal parts: The first step in the Merge Sort algorithm is to divide the data set into two equal halves. This is done by finding the middle point of the data set and splitting the data into two parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursively sort each half: Once the data set is divided into two halves, the Merge Sort function is called recursively on each half. The recursive calls continue until each half of the data is sorted into single-element arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge the sorted halves: Once each half of the data is sorted, the two halves are merged back into one final sorted array. The merging process involves comparing the first elements of each half and inserting the smaller element into the final array. This process continues until one of the halves is empty. The remaining elements of the other half are then inserted into the final array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat the process until the entire data is sorted: The Merge Sort function is called recursively until the entire data set is sorted.\n",
    "Algorithm\n",
    "Create a helper function called merge which takes in the original array arr, indices left, mid, right, and a temporary array tempArr as parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the start indices and sizes of the two halves of the array. The first half starts from the left index and the second half starts from mid+1.\n",
    "Copy elements of both halves into the temporary array.\n",
    "Merge the sub-arrays from the temporary array tempArr back into the original array arr in a sorted order using a while loop. The loop runs until either the first half or second half is completely merged. In each iteration, the smaller of the two elements from the first and second half is copied into the original array \"arr\".\n",
    "Copy any remaining elements from the first half or second half into the original array.\n",
    "Create a recursive function called mergeSort which takes in the original array arr, indices left, right, and a temporary array tempArr as parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check if the left index is greater than or equal to the right index. If it is, we return from the function.\n",
    "Calculate the mid index.\n",
    "Sort the first and second halves of the array recursively by calling the mergeSort function.\n",
    "Merge the sorted halves by calling the merge function.\n",
    "Create a temporary array temporaryArray with the same size as the nums array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Call the mergeSort function on the nums array with boundary, 0, and nums.size()-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the sorted array nums.\n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "Here, nnn is the number of elements in the nums array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity: O(nlog⁡n)O(n \\log n)O(nlogn)\n",
    "\n",
    "We divide the nums array into two halves till there is only one element in the array, which will lead to O(log⁡n)O(\\log n)O(logn) steps.\n",
    "n→n/2→n/4→...→1 (k steps)n \\rarr n/2 \\rarr n/4 \\rarr ... \\rarr 1 \\space (\\text{k steps})n→n/2→n/4→...→1 (k steps)\n",
    "n/2(k−1)=1  ⟹  n / 2^{(k-1)} = 1 \\impliesn/2 \n",
    "(k−1)\n",
    " =1⟹ k≈log⁡nk \\approx \\log nk≈logn\n",
    "And after each division, we merge those respective halves which will take O(n)O(n)O(n) time each.\n",
    "Thus, overall it takes O(nlog⁡n)O(n \\log n)O(nlogn) time.\n",
    "Space complexity: O(n)O(n)O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive stack will take O(log⁡n)O(\\log n)O(logn) space and we used an additional array temporaryArray of size nnn.\n",
    "Thus, overall we use O(log⁡n+n)=O(n)O(\\log n + n) = O(n)O(logn+n)=O(n) space."
