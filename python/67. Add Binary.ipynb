    "The expression ord(a[i]) - ord('0') is used in the code to convert a binary character ('0' or '1') into its corresponding integer value (0 or 1). This conversion is necessary for performing numerical operations like addition and determining the carry. Here's how it works:\n",

    "ord(char): This is a built-in Python function that returns the integer representing the Unicode code point of the given Unicode character. For example, ord('0') returns 48 and ord('1') returns 49.\n",
    "ord(a[i]) - ord('0'): When you subtract the Unicode value of '0' from the Unicode value of the character at a[i] (which could be '0' or '1'), you effectively convert the character '0' to the integer 0 and the character '1' to the integer 1. Hereâ€™s the math:\n",
    "If a[i] is '0': ord('0') - ord('0') = 48 - 48 = 0\n",
    "If a[i] is '1': ord('1') - ord('0') = 49 - 48 = 1\n",
    "This technique is a common way to convert a character digit into its numeric equivalent in programming, particularly when dealing with characters that represent numbers in various bases (like binary in this case). Using ord() ensures that you're working with actual numbers in your calculations, allowing you to perform arithmetic operations correctly."
