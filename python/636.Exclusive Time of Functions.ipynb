    "636. Exclusive Time of Functions\n",

    "Companies\n",
    "On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function calls are stored in a call call_stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the call_stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the call_stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the call_stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string \"{function_id}:{\"start\" | \"end\"}:{timestamp}\". For example, \"0:start:3\" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and \"1:end:2\" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"1:start:2\",\"1:end:5\",\"0:end:6\"]\n",
    "Output: [3,4]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.\n",
    "Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.\n",
    "Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\n",
    "So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = 1, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"0:start:6\",\"0:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\n",
    "Output: [8]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\n",
    "Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\n",
    "Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.\n",
    "Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\n",
    "Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.\n",
    "So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"1:start:6\",\"1:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\n",
    "Output: [7,1]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\n",
    "Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\n",
    "Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.\n",
    "Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6.\n",
    "Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.\n",
    "So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 <= n <= 100\n",
    "1 <= logs.length <= 500\n",
    "0 <= function_id < n\n",
    "0 <= timestamp <= 109\n",
    "No two start events will happen at the same timestamp.\n",
    "No two end events will happen at the same timestamp.\n",
    "Each function has an \"end\" log for each \"start\" log."
