    "Approach 2: Two HashMaps\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that we decided the length of the ransom note is nnn, and the length of the magazine is mmm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an interview, you might start by describing the previous approach and determining its time complexity, but not actually implementing it. Your next goal would be to reason carefully about the implementation and its time complexity, to identify parts that could be made more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing the nnn factor from the time complexity is going to be impossible, because we need to at least look at each character in the ransom note. Otherwise, how could we possibly know whether or not we have the characters we need to make it? We might be able to avoid the need for an O(m)O(m)O(m) operation for every one of the nnn characters in the ransom note though.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, notice that if there's three 'a''s in the ransom note, then there needs to be at least three 'a's in the magazine. This should be fairly intuitive, as you'd encounter it if trying to make a note out of a magazine for real. The same idea applies for all the other unique characters too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a better way of solving the problem would be to count up how many of each letter are in both the magazine and the ransom note. We can represent the counts with a HashMap that has characters as keys, and counts as values. For example, the string \"leetcode is cool\" is represented as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The counts\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make two HashMaps; one for the magazine, and the other for the ransom note. Here is the pseudocode for making one of these \"counts\" HashMaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "define function makeCountsMap(string):\n",
    "    counts = a new HashMap\n",
    "    for each char in string:\n",
    "        if char not in counts:\n",
    "            counts.put(char, 1)\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            old_count = counts.get(char)\n",
    "            counts.put(char, old_count + 1)\n",
    "    return counts\n",
    "Then, to actually check whether or not the ransom note can be made using the magazine, we should loop over each character of the ransom note, checking how many of it we need, and checking that at least that many exist in the magazine, by looking it up in the magazine HashMap. We need to be careful of the case where the character we need isn't in the magazine at all; in this case we should return False as the number of them in the magazine is definitely smaller than the number we need. If we manage to check all the characters without False being returned, then we know that we must have had enough characters to complete the note, and can therefore return True. Here is some pseudocode for that algorithm.\n",

    "noteCounts = makeCountsMap(ransomNote)\n",

    "        return False\n",
    "return True\n",
    "Here is an animation showing the above algorithm in action with the ransom note \"leetcode is cool\" and the magazine \"close call as fools take sides\".\n",
    "And here is another example, with the same ransom note, but the magazine \"cats close in on the fish\".\n",
    "There's one more optimization we can make. Notice that if the length of the ransom note is longer than the length of the magazine, then its impossible for there to be enough characters in the magazine.\n",

    "\n",
    "We'll say mmm is the length of the magazine, and nnn is the length of the ransom note.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "When m<nm < nm<n, we immediately return false. Therefore, the worst case occurs when m≥nm ≥ nm≥n.\n",

    "Creating a HashMap of counts for the magazine is O(m)O(m)O(m), as each insertion/ count update is is O(1)O(1)O(1), and is done for each of the mmm characters.\n",

    "Likewise, creating the HashMap of counts for the ransom note is O(n)O(n)O(n).\n",
    "\n",

    "This gives us O(n)+O(n)+O(m)O(n) + O(n) + O(m)O(n)+O(n)+O(m). Now, remember how we said m≥nm ≥ nm≥n? This means that we can simplify it to O(m)+O(m)+O(m)=3⋅O(m)=O(m)O(m) + O(m) + O(m) = 3 \\cdot O(m) = O(m)O(m)+O(m)+O(m)=3⋅O(m)=O(m), dropping the constant of 333.\n",

    "We build two HashMaps of counts; each with up to kkk characters in them. This means that they take up O(k)O(k)O(k) space.\n",
