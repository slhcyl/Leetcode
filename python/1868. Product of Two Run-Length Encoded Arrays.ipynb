    "Hint\n",
    "Run-length encoding is a compression algorithm that allows for an integer array nums with many segments of consecutive repeated numbers to be represented by a (generally smaller) 2D array encoded. Each encoded[i] = [vali, freqi] describes the ith segment of repeated numbers in nums where vali is the value that is repeated freqi times.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, nums = [1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2] is represented by the run-length encoded array encoded = [[1,3],[2,5]]. Another way to read this is \"three 1's followed by five 2's\".\n",
    "The product of two run-length encoded arrays encoded1 and encoded2 can be calculated using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Expand both encoded1 and encoded2 into the full arrays nums1 and nums2 respectively.\n",
    "Create a new array prodNums of length nums1.length and set prodNums[i] = nums1[i] * nums2[i].\n",
    "Compress prodNums into a run-length encoded array and return it.\n",
    "You are given two run-length encoded arrays encoded1 and encoded2 representing full arrays nums1 and nums2 respectively. Both nums1 and nums2 have the same length. Each encoded1[i] = [vali, freqi] describes the ith segment of nums1, and each encoded2[j] = [valj, freqj] describes the jth segment of nums2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the product of encoded1 and encoded2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Compression should be done such that the run-length encoded array has the minimum possible length.\n",

    "Input: encoded1 = [[1,3],[2,3]], encoded2 = [[6,3],[3,3]]\n",
    "Output: [[6,6]]\n",
    "Explanation: encoded1 expands to [1,1,1,2,2,2] and encoded2 expands to [6,6,6,3,3,3].\n",
    "prodNums = [6,6,6,6,6,6], which is compressed into the run-length encoded array [[6,6]].\n",
