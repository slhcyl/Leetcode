    "In the second phase, we again have two pointers traversing the list at the same speed until they meet. The maximum distance to be covered in this phase will not be greater than the length of the list (recall that the hare just needs to get back to the entrance of the cycle). So, this phase also runs in O(n)O(n)O(n) time.\n",

    "In Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm, when the slow and fast pointers meet inside the cycle, it indicates that there is indeed a cycle in the linked list. However, it doesn't directly tell us the starting node of the cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the starting node of the cycle, we reset one of the pointers (usually the slow pointer) to the head of the linked list and keep the other pointer (fast pointer) at the meeting point inside the cycle. Then, we move both pointers at the same pace (one step at a time) until they meet again. The point at which they meet again is the starting node of the cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why this approach works:\n",
    "\n",
    "When the slow pointer starts from the head of the linked list and the fast pointer starts from the meeting point inside the cycle, both pointers move at the same pace.\n",
    "The slow pointer moves k steps to reach the starting node of the cycle, where k is the distance between the head of the linked list and the starting node of the cycle.\n",
    "The fast pointer also moves k steps, but it has already traversed the cycle n times (where n is an integer) before meeting the slow pointer. So, it also reaches the starting node of the cycle at the same time as the slow pointer.\n",
    "Both pointers meet at the starting node of the cycle.\n",
    "Therefore, by resetting one pointer to the head of the linked list and moving both pointers at the same pace until they meet again, we can accurately determine the starting node of the cycle."
