    "You may have noticed that our recurrence relation from the previous two approaches only cares about 2 steps below the current step. For example, if we are calculating the minimum cost to reach step 12, we only care about data from step 10 and step 11. While we would have needed to calculate the minimum cost for steps 2-9 as well, at the time of the actual calculation for step 12, we no longer care about any of those steps.\n",

We will start iteration from step 2, which means these variables will initially represent the minimum cost to reach steps 0 and 1, so we will initialize each of them to 0.\n",

    "Iterate over the array, again with 1 extra iteration at the end to treat the top floor as the final \"step\". At each iteration, simulate moving 1 step up. This means downOne will now refer to the current step, so apply our recurrence relation to update downOne. downTwo will be whatever downOne was prior to the update, so let's use a temporary variable to help with the update.\n",
