    "For the backtracking function, initially we could have at most 4 directions to explore, but further the choices are reduced into 3 (since we won't go back to where we come from).\n",
    "As a result, the execution trace after the first step could be visualized as a 3-nary tree, each of the branches represent a potential exploration in the corresponding direction. Therefore, in the worst case, the total number of invocation would be the number of nodes in a full 3-nary tree, which is about 3^L.\n",

    "We iterate through the board for backtracking, i.e. there could be NNN times invocation for the backtracking function in the worst case.\n",

    "Space Complexity: O(L) where LLL is the length of the word to be matched.\n",
    "The main consumption of the memory lies in the recursion call of the backtracking function. The maximum length of the call stack would be the length of the word. Therefore, the space complexity of the algorithm is O(L)."
