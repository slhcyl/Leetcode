    "1472. Design Browser History\n",
    "Solved\n",
    "Medium\n",
    "Topics\n",
    "Companies\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "You have a browser of one tab where you start on the homepage and you can visit another url, get back in the history number of steps or move forward in the history number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the BrowserHistory class:\n",
    "\n",
    "BrowserHistory(string homepage) Initializes the object with the homepage of the browser.\n",
    "void visit(string url) Visits url from the current page. It clears up all the forward history.\n",
    "string back(int steps) Move steps back in history. If you can only return x steps in the history and steps > x, you will return only x steps. Return the current url after moving back in history at most steps.\n",
    "string forward(int steps) Move steps forward in history. If you can only forward x steps in the history and steps > x, you will forward only x steps. Return the current url after forwarding in history at most steps.\n",
    " \n",

    "[[\"leetcode.com\"],[\"google.com\"],[\"facebook.com\"],[\"youtube.com\"],[1],[1],[1],[\"linkedin.com\"],[2],[2],[7]]\n",

    "[null,null,null,null,\"facebook.com\",\"google.com\",\"facebook.com\",null,\"linkedin.com\",\"google.com\",\"leetcode.com\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "BrowserHistory browserHistory = new BrowserHistory(\"leetcode.com\");\n",

    "Approach 2: Doubly Linked List\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "We can also use a linked list to store the history as a linked list can be used to simulate a stack.\n",
    "We can insert as many nodes (history URLs) as we like, and if it is a doubly linked list we can traverse back and forth in it to implement the \"back\" and \"forward\" operations.\n",
    "When we visit a new URL, instead of deleting all \"future\" nodes, we can just disconnect the link at the current node and add a new node.\n",
    "This approach is less optimized than the first approach, but we are listing it here as it will provide some hint and is the stepping stone for the last approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following slideshow has been added to help you visualize this approach:\n",
    "Algorithm\n",
    "Create a class DLLNode for each node of the doubly linked list:\n",
    "It contains a string variable data to store the URL string.\n",
    "And two pointers prev and next pointing to the rest of the doubly linked list.\n",
    "In the BrowserHistory class, we create two variables:\n",
    "linkedListHead, points to the head of our doubly linked list and is storing the homepage URL.\n",
    "current, it will always point to the current URL node in our doubly linked list.\n",
    "Implementing visit(url) method:\n",
    "We create a new node for url.\n",
    "Make our current node's next point to this new node and the new node's prev point to the current node. Thus, deleting the link of the next nodes of current and inserting the new node in our doubly linked list.\n",
    "Then, mark this new node as the current node.\n",
    "Implementing back(steps) method:\n",
    "We will move the current pointer towards the left (using prev pointer) in the doubly linked list if nodes are present and the step number of nodes is not traversed.\n",
    "At the end, we return the current node's URL.\n",
    "Implementing forward(steps) method:\n",
    "We will move the current pointer towards the right (using next pointer) in the doubly linked list if nodes are present and the step number of nodes is not traversed.\n",
    "At the end, we return the current node's URL.\n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "Let's assume here, nnn visit calls are made, mmm is the maximum number of steps to go forward or back, and lll is the maximum length of a URL string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the visit(url) method, we insert a new node in our doubly linked list, it will take O(l)O(l)O(l) time to create a new node (to allocate memory for lll characters of the url string), and then we mark this new node as current which will take O(1)O(1)O(1) time.\n",
    "Thus, in the worst case each call to the visit(url) method will take O(l)O(l)O(l) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the back(steps) and forward(steps) methods, we iterate on our doubly linked list nodes and stop when mmm nodes are iterated or we reached the end.\n",
    "Thus, in the worst case, each call to these methods will take O(min⁡(m,n))O(\\min(m, n))O(min(m,n)) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "We might visit nnn URL strings and they will be stored in our doubly linked list.\n",
    "Thus, in the worse case, we use O(l⋅n)O(l \\cdot n)O(l⋅n) space."
