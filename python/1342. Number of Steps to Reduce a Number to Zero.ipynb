The last bit to remove will always be a 1—it was the most significant bit in the original num. The algorithm above would add 2 for removing this final 1. But actually, when we subtract 1 from it, it goes to zero. So we don't need add two steps for this bit. The simplest way of handling this case is to subtract 1 from our final steps count, as we know this \"off-by-one-error\" will always happen (except when the initial num is 0, we need to be careful of that edge case too!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at another example. The number we'll use is 78; this can be written in binary as 1001110. The binary contains four 1s and three 0s, so our total number of steps must be (4 * 2) + (3 * 1) - 1 = 10. This the correct result!\n",

    "Approach 3: Counting Bits with Bitwise Operators\n",
    "In Approach 2, we needed to convert the number into a string representation. Strings are considerably larger than the integer they represent though. Another way of inspecting bits, to check if they're 1 or 0, is to use the bitwise-and (&) operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of a & b (a bitwise-and b) looks at each bit in both a and b at the same time. If both bits are 1 then bitwise-and sets the same bit of the result to 1, but if either are 0 it sets the bit to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, 109 and 57 can be written as 1101101 and 111001 respectively. This image shows what happens when we bitwise-and them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitwise and of 109 and 57 showing result\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to actually inspect a specific bit, we can use a number that has a 1 followed by enough 0s to put the 1 at the position we want it (we commonly call this a \"bitmask\"). With this number, we bitwise-and (&) it with the input number. If the input number has a 1 at the same position, it'll output 1 at that position, and because all other numbers are 0 they will be 0 in the output as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "These numbers of the form 1, followed by some number of 0s, are actually just the powers of two, where the power is the number of 0s after the one. As such, we can check if a bit is a 1 in a number by doing num & (1 << bit) where bit is the bit we want to check (0-indexed from the right).\n",

    "\n",
    "Bitwise and of 109 and 32 showing result of 32\n",

    "The output is 0000000, which is zero. Therefore, we know that the fifth bit must be a 0.\n",
