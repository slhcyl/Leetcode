These statements are equal because if we had one 0 in our consecutive array, we could flip it to satisfy our condition. Note that we're not actually going to flip the 0 which will make our approach simpler.\n",

    "If our sequence is valid, let's continue expanding our sequence (because our goal is to get the largest sequence possible).\n",
    "If our sequence is invalid, let's stop expanding and contract our sequence (because an invalid sequence will never count towards our largest sequence).\n",

    "\n",
    "Valid State = one or fewer 0's in our current sequence\n",

    "Great. How do we apply all this to the sliding window?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use left and right pointers to keep track of the current sequence a.k.a. our window. Let's expand our window by moving the right pointer forward until we reach a point where we have more than one 0 in our window.
