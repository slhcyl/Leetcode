    "You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a list of strings operations, where operations[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "An integer x.\n",
    "Record a new score of x.\n",
    "'+'.\n",
    "Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.\n",

    "\"5\" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].\n",
    "\"2\" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].\n",
    "\"C\" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].\n",
