    "You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:\n",
    "\n",
    "If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and\n",
    "If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.\n",
    "At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.\n",

    "Explanation: \n",
    "We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,\n",
    "we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,\n",
    "we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,\n",
    "we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of the last stone.\n",
